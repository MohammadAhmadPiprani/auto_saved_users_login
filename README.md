# auto_saved_users_login
I have made a program that saves the new user name in a specific file and after that we can see from a specific file about users login information
 What This Script Does
 First it takes the name as an input from the users
 which login then after that it saves this information in a particular file
 after that when we executes this so,
                                     we can clearly see the user name with date.
